OpenGL SuperBible 7th Edition Examples - How to Build
=====================================================

This source code archive uses CMake to build. The samples also use GLFW library, a
snapshot of which is included in the `extern` folder. It's also possible to use a different
copy of GLFW if desired, but that's an exercise for you. Instructions for each supported
platform are as follows:

Windows / Microsoft Visual Studio 2013
--------------------------------------

Install CMake. Windows binaries are available from http://www.cmake.org/.
Ensure that CMake is in your path.
Open a command prompt and change to the directory where you've checked out the code.

### Build GLFW

If you are going to use the copy of GLFW included in the archive, enter the
GLFW directory in `extern/glfw-3.0.4`, and type:

    cmake -G "Visual Studio 12" .

(Yes, that's not a mistake - Visual Studio 12 is 2013)

Open the resulting GLFW.sln file in Visual Studio and build both the debug and release configurations.

Copy and rename the resulting glfw3 libraries:

* Copy `glfw-3.0.4/src/Debug/glfw3.lib` into the `lib` directory and **rename it to glfw3_d.lib**.
* Copy `glf3-3.0.4/src/Release/glfw3.lib` into the `lib` directory but don't rename it.

### Build the samples

Open a command prompt and change to the build directory in the source archive.
Type:

    cmake -G "Visual Studio 12" ..

Open the resulting superbible7.sln project in Visual Studio.

The examples will build into the `bin` directory.

Linux
-----

As with Windows, the project uses CMake to create build files. You'll
need to install it with the appropriate method for your distribution. On
Debian-based distributions (such as Ubuntu and Mint):

    sudo apt-get install cmake

You'll also need to satisfy dependencies. In particular, you'll need GL and
GLX headers and libs (generally included in Mesa packages), and GLFW. You can use
the snapshot of GLFW included in the archive, if you wish, but pre-compiled
packages should be available through package management on most distributions.

Once you have everything, you should enter the "build" directory in the source
archive and issue:

    cmake ..
    make

The examples will build into the 'bin' directory.

Other platforms
---------------

The code will probably build for other platforms, especially if they are
relatively non-obscure, but nothing besides Windows/Visual Studio and Linux
has been tested. It's up to you to find a capable OpenGL 4.x driver for
your platform of choice. CMake should also be able to build the appropriate
project files for environments such as Code::Blocks and Eclipse, but again,
this is untested.


*Please note carefully: EVEN IF YOU CAN BUILD THE SOURCES FOR YOUR FAVORITE
PLATFORM OF CHOICE, YOU NEED RECENT OpenGL 4.x DRIVERS TO RUN THEM. PLEASE
DON'T PAN THE BOOK BECAUSE YOUR COMPUTER DOESN'T SUPPORT OpenGL 4.x. THANKS*

Running the samples
-------------------

*This part is really important. Please read it!*

Most of the samples require some media files. The media files package is a
separate download available from http://www.openglsuperbible.com and is
roughly 100MB of textures, object files and shader code. Unpack the archive
to the bin/media directory before trying to run these samples.
